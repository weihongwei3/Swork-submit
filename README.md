Statement Regarding Partial Code Release and Upcoming Updates

We sincerely appreciate your interest in our work and your feedback regarding the current state of the code repository.

The code released at this time contains the backbone network architecture of our system. The BSS and PSS modules, which are critical to achieving the full performance improvements reported in our previous work, are temporarily withheld.

This decision stems from the following reasons:

Ongoing Academic Research: Our research group is actively building upon the BSS/PSS framework to develop significant enhancements for a new publication. Premature release could jeopardize the integrity of our ongoing research and the peer-review process.

Protection of Novel Contributions: The BSS/PSS modules represent novel, unpublished advancements. Releasing them immediately would undermine our ability to formally present and claim these contributions in the upcoming manuscript.



We are actively working towards submission and aim to make the full code available as soon as the publication process allows.

Value of Current Release: The provided backbone network is a functional and essential component. Researchers can use it as a foundation, integrate it with their own modules, or verify the core structural claims of our prior work.

We understand the desire for full access and share the open-source ethos. This temporary partial release is solely to protect the novelty of our current research efforts while still providing a substantial part of the implementation. We believe releasing the backbone now benefits the community by enabling foundational work and reproducibility discussions.

We value your understanding and patience. Please watch this repository or the upcoming publication for announcements regarding the release of the BSS/PSS modules.

Best regards.
